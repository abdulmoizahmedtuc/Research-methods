This folder contains a paper written by me to better understand the project "Weapon's license verification system". Goal of writing this paper is to follow methodologies for paper writing/reading and the structure of research paper / thesis / project.

Following the structure and how to write your paper was the main goal of my course *"Research Methods"*, which I studied during my M.Sc.

As of 09/11/2021 the folder contains only the **Weapon's license verification system.pdf file**. This file was created on Latex editor and downloaded as .pdf.
