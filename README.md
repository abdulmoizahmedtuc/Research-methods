This folder contains the .pdf file to better understand the project Weapon's license verification system with the main focus on methodologies for paper writing/reading. Followed by the structure of research paper / thesis / project.

Following the structure and how to write your paper was the main goal of the course *"Research Method"*, which I studied during my M.Sc.

As of 2021/08/11 the folder contains only the **Weapon's license verification system.pdf file** and created on Latex editor.
